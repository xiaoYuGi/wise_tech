It was 6 years ago when I got my first job in this industry. My major during my bachelor's degree was International Trade and Economics, and it was really hard to find a suitable job after my graduation in 2016. So, the first two years after I graduated from university were a dark and painful time for me. My parents could not give me the help I really needed, and I didn’t know what I could do or should do to break through. One day, I saw a Java basic tutorial while browsing videos on YouTube. I thought that maybe I could try it if I was interested. So I started learning Java programming on my own. It took me about 8 months to get my first job. I didn’t talk about my first job, but the experience of getting it was hard for me without any help from others. I won’t forget that time in my life."
