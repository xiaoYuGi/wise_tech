Yeah, it's an ugly choice as an outsource here. So why do you still here wasting your own life for this trash.Maybe the reason is that you can't leave here on your own.

A：It sounds like you are feeling frustrated with your current situation as an outsource worker. It can be tough to feel stuck, especially when you want to grow and find better opportunities.
Sometimes, people stay in these jobs because they feel secure, or they are unsure about how to change their situation. It’s important to remember that you have the power to make choices for your future.
You can start by learning new skills or updating your resume. This may help you feel more confident about applying to different jobs.

corrected version: Can you use C1-level expressions to respond to me with your opinion? I will try to imitate your skills in expressing myself and improve my speaking skills. At the same time, you can tell me if I used them correctly. **Explanation of corrections:** 1. "can you using" should be "can you use" - "using" is incorrect here; it should be the base form "use." 2. "imporve" should be "improve" - just a spelling mistake. 3. "In the same time" should be "At the same time" - the correct phrase is "at the same time."

A:
I appreciate your desire to improve your speaking skills! Practicing at a higher level can certainly help you grow.
In my opinion, feeling stuck in a job can be quite disheartening, particularly when you aspire to achieve more. It’s crucial to recognize your own potential and take proactive steps towards change. While security in a job may offer comfort, personal and professional development is also essential for long-term satisfaction.
I encourage you to focus on enhancing your skill set and consider networking opportunities, as these can open doors to new possibilities.
How do you plan to practice your speaking skills?

basic version: I really appreciate your advise. I keep enhancing my skills in the past rencet months, But i still not confident to send my resume to the company i want to go. can you trans my respond to a c1 level expressing first and give me your new adivce after this

corrected version: I really appreciate your advice. I have been enhancing my skills in the recent months, but I am still not confident enough to send my resume to the company I want to apply to. Can you transform my response to a C1 level expression and give me your new advice afterward? **Corrections:** 1. "advise" should be "advice" - "Advice" is a noun, while "advise" is a verb. 2. "rencet" should be "recent" - This is a misspelling. 3. "But i still not confident" should be "but I am still not confident" - The sentence needs the verb "am" for proper structure and "I" should be capitalized. 4. "to go" should be "to apply to" - "Apply to" is the correct phrase when referring to sending a resume to a company. Here is your revised response at a C1 level: "I sincerely appreciate your advice. Over the past several months, I have been diligently enhancing my skills; however, I still lack the confidence to submit my resume to the company I aspire to join. Could you please assist me in refining my response and offer any additional advice?" **Advice:** To build your confidence in applying, consider the following steps: 1. **Seek Feedback:** Share your resume with peers or mentors to get constructive feedback. 2. **Practice Interviews:** Conduct mock interviews to become more comfortable discussing your skills and experiences. 3. **Set Small Goals:** Instead of focusing solely on the application, set smaller goals like researching the company or preparing a cover letter. 4. **Positive Visualization:** Visualize yourself successfully applying and interviewing, which can help reduce anxiety.

A:I'm glad you found my advice helpful! Here’s your response expressed at a C1 level:
"I truly appreciate your advice. I have been working diligently to enhance my skills over the past few months; however, I still lack the confidence to submit my resume to the companies I aspire to join."
As for advice, it's natural to feel apprehensive about sending your resume, but remember that every application is a step towards your goals. Perhaps start by sharing your resume with a trusted friend or mentor to get their feedback. Additionally, practice interviewing with them to build your confidence.
Taking small steps can make a big difference. What specific aspect of the application process makes you feel less confident?
